This program COPIES the CreateHeatmap Class to a selected UE4 C++ Project.


Select the Visual Studio solution file and then ALL files, and 'select' folders are COPIED to a DIFFERENT folder, with the 'new' name.



By pressing F1, a Dialog is opened for you to:

    SELECT a Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file



Another Dialog will then ask for the 'NEW' solution name AND the folder to COPY to.



All required FILES will be COPIED.

Any .sln, .uproject, .h/.cpp, .cs files will be RENAMED and ALL references from 'old' to 'new' will be changed WITHIN each file.

ALL references from 'old' to 'new' will be changed WITHIN each .ini file too.

The CreateHeatmap C++ Class files will be copied too.


In addition, a 'REDIRECT' will be ADDED to the DefaultEngine.ini file. 

The DefaultInput.ini will also be updated so that a Key press will create a Heatmap.png file, based on ALL player movement.



AFTER completion, please RIGHT-CLICK over the .uproject file, and select 'Generate Visual Studio project files'.



Font size can be increased / decreased by pressing + or - on the Numeric keypad.
